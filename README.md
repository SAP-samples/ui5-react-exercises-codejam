App designed to be a React/UI5 Web Components for React companion to the UI5 Bookshop app.

# How to run app
Install node modules by running `npm i` or `yarn install` in bookshop folder and bookshop/app.

To run frontend without backend, go to `bookshop/app` and run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will get the frontend running but there won't be any data in the tables. Running the start command should open a tab in the browser, but if not, go to http://localhost:3000.

To get data, the backend also needs to be started. To do so, navigate to `bookshop` and run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
